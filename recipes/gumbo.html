        >"The definition of gumbo is almost as slippery as that of Creole. Just
        as gumbo can contain pretty much any kind of meat or seafood, Creole is
        a vague and inclusive term for native New Orleanians, who may be black
        or white, depending on whom you're asking."</i

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. (4 sticks) unsalted butter </li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 red bell peppers, in medium dice</li>
      <li>2 celery stalks, in medium dice</li>
      <li>1 ¼ gallon (20 cups) chicken stock</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Creole seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 lb. andouille sausage, cut into ¼ inch-thick slices</li>
      <li>3 ½ lb. chicken, roasted and boned</li>
      <li>hot sauce to taste</li>
      <li>boiled rice as accompaniment</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a 12-quart stockpot melt butter over moderately low heat. Gradually add a third of the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds. Add a third more flour and sit constantly 30 seconds. Add remaining third of flour and stir constantly 30 seconds. Continue to cook roux, stirring constantly, until it is the color of dark mahogany, about 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Add bell peppers and stir constantly 30 seconds. Add onions and celery and stir constantly 30 seconds. Add the stock to roux, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Add all remaining ingredients except chicken, rice, and hot sauce and bring to boil. Simmer gumbo, uncovered, 45 minutes, skimming off any fat and stirring occasionally. Add chicken and simmer 15 minutes. Adjust seasoning with hot sauce. Serve over rice.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>This recipe yields about 6 quarts, but gumbo freezes well and can be thawed without losing flavor.</li>
